this R programme used to tidy data from  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

It is a raw data from wearable equipment during diffrent move styles.
Using R, I put the same kind of data togehter. Then rearrange the colummns of the raw data with move styles in differnt file.
Finally, I add new columms of activity and labels to the dataframe, and get the mean of the each colummns.
